**Meme Generator**

I use a trending memes API to fetch a meme image, which is then displayed on the web. Users can enter two sentences to appear on the top and bottom of the meme. As users type, their text dynamically appears on the meme image in real-time.
**Tenzie Game**

This is a childrenâ€™s game where tiles display random numbers. The objective is to select one number and match all tiles to that number. To refresh the numbers on the unselected tiles, users can press a button to roll a new batch of numbers.
